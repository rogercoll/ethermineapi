# Reading data From Ethermine API

It's a basic website that reads data from:

- https://api.coinmarketcap.com/api    (gets value of Ethereum in USD dollars and Euro)
- https://api.ethermine.org/api         

It's useful to see the hashrate, unpaid balance or the value in euros of a miner. All data is read in Json format and displayed in the Html.
